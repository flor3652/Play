My personal playing repository, for messing around with any ideas wherever I am. It is meant to be an outlet for R programming as well as, to some degree, artistic creation and expression. I suppose at the end of the day, it is simply intended to be an outlet... Feel free to join in if you, like me, would like to do some projects, silly or serious, just for the fun of doing them.
